I added CSS properties: class attribute, class selector, id attribute, id selector, role attribute, attribute selectors, font family, 
font size, font style, font variant, font weight, font property shorthand, text align, text decoration, line height, 
color (in a few ways), border and shorthand, padding and shorthand, margin and shorthand to my HTML website.

Improvements:
 - Change the color of the tables to be better seen on dark screens.
 - Add more recipes
 - Change the color of the Medium recipes to be better seen on dark screens.
 - Video descriptions are not being shown when videos are not being loaded.
 - Format some text on Hard difficult.
