        <h2><u>Macaron Cookie Recipe</u></h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Egg Whites</li>
            <li>1/4 cup White</li>
            <li>1 & 2/3 cups Confectioners' Sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Baking Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer with a fited whisk attachment, beat egg whites until foamy.</li>
            <li>Add white to foamy egg whites and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, 
                about 1 & 1/2 inch in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak insted of flattening
                immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</li>
            <li>When the batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted
                with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. 
                Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 285 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, about 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Let cookies cool completely before filling, about 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
