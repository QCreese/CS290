1. List 5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike
   ex: layout, presentation, or overload of info
   - YouTube
   - Canvis
   - PlayStation Store
   - Zoom
   - CenturyLink
3. a link to the site and what you like or dislike and ways that you think each of the 5 websites might be improved
   - YouTube: https://www.youtube.com
       - YouTube is a great website in my opinion, but it feels like it doesn't show the videos that the people I'm
         subscribed to make. Instead other creators are showing up. I don't mind it, but maybe the website could create
         a 'fresh creater' tab that shows new content from creaters that you haven't seen.
       - Canvis: https://www.canvis.edu
         - Canvis is an amazing learning platorm for students to preactice and learn about whatever degree that are shooting for,
           but I feel like the page layout on canvis doesn't feel planned out. Yes, the login button is in the top right and the
           menu tab follows you as you scroll through the page, but something doesn't feel right about the webpage.
      - PlayStation Store: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/pages/latest
        - The PS Store is brutal on the eyes. The white and blue are supposed to draw users in, but it makes me want to close the browser.
          I believe, new colors would help users stay on the webpage. The page should also show short clips of the game you are hovered over.
      - Zoom: https://zoom.us/
        - Zoom is a good communication platform, but when you load up the zoom webpage there is a billion things happening!
          I like the placement of the login button, but the webpage is too crowded.
    
      - CenturyLink: https://www.centurylink.com/
        - I am bias against CenturyLink because of all the issues I've had with them! Their webpage is very clean, but their service is not good.
        - I suppose the only issue I have with their website is information presented. I have never heard of anyone receiving 100 mps download speeds
        - with CenturyLink.
